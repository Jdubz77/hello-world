# hello-world

A bit about me:
I am completely new to github. I just happened to stumble across it 
when I was trying to download a program, and was linked here. Still not very confident
in my understandings of how this all works. But I seemed to have found the right place to
start! (Just following the "Hello World guide/tutorial)

I recently found that I have an interest in learning to code (with the end goal of becoming 
a software developer). This interest was sparked when I began looking into mobile phone security, 
and at some point downloaded an app called "Ethical Hacking." Consequently I downloaded several more
(i.e. Hacking Tutorials 2.0, Programming Hub, Code Sheet, Daily Linux Commands, etc).
There's so much information available on the internet, that just finding
a place to start is a daunting task in and of itself! But it's exciting, and I'm willing to learn
and put in the work. I want to understand how it all works, and have not intention of being a black hat 
or a script kiddie! (Anyone can hit Ctrl C / Ctrl V). I want to know what makes my computer tic, 
how Python, Javascript and HTML work, I want to know how to keep my information safe and private, 
and hopefully be able to contribute and help others along the way!
